Welcome to my first project:

Puzzle Mania!

* PURPOSE:

It's a website for all people who loves to puzzle, or are curious about it and might want to start to puzzle themselfes. 
You can be a total newbie and still join the puzzle mania club. It's easy to understand what the websites purpose. It has a navigation meny at the top of the website where you can read more about what happends at meet and greets or even sign up to join the puzzle club.

* BUGS:
  - want to move all divs in the #club section to the right handside by using a class. added the same flex to all divs but only the last one goes to the right handside on mobile version. when i check on a regular website all divs in the club section are to the right handside. 
  Got it to work by adding text-align:end to the .div-right class.
  - the hero image doesnt load. Solution: removed the background color for the div in the #hero-image section
