Welcome to my first project:

SAFARI RETREAT!

- PURPOSE:

It's a website for people who are looking forward to relax in the sun or go on a adventure and join the safaris. Or maybe both!

- UX DESIGN:

- CODE:

  - The code for the social media links in the footer are taken from Love Running project. URL: https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/Love-Running-Solutions.git
  - the media querys comments in css are taken from Love Running project. URL: <https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/Love-Running-Solutions.git>
  - used information from the site: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50178709/set-my-logo-to-the-left-and-navigation-menu-to-the-right-using-flexbox to make the toggle navigation menu stick to the right side

- TECHNOLOGIES

  - icons in subheadings and footer are from <https://fontawesome.com/>
  - https://validator.w3.org/nu/ to validate html code
  - https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ to validate css code
  - https://www.pexels.com/sv-se/ and https://pikwizard.com/ for images
  - favicon from: <https://fontawesome.com/icons/puzzle-piece?f=classic&s=solid&pc=%234e6858>
  - used https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/ to generate the favicon
  - https://www.remove.bg/ to remove background from favicon
  - video in safari section in the index.html page from <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Krh9ccPOx-M>

- BUGS:

  - want to move all divs in the #club section to the right handside by using a class. added the same flex to all divs but only the last one goes to the right handside on mobile version. when i check on a regular website all divs in the club section are to the right handside.
    Got it to work by adding text-align:end to the .div-right class.
  - the hero image doesnt load. Solution: removed the background color for the div in the #hero-image section
  - when I first deployed this project the images and css code didnt work. the solution was to correct all the pathways to relative ones insted of absolute.

- MEDIA:

- COLOR SCHEME:

  - #9632f4 for the font for headers, nav-meny and icons
  - #97afa7 for navigation menus font and social media icons in the footer
